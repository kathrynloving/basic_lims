Basic example of displaying assay data in a web app

To run locally, set up a Python virtual environment and then launch the app:
virtualenv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ./app.py 

A subset of the BindingDB data is included by default.
Try uploading new_data.csv and viewing again!

Feel free to load the full set of tight-binding compounds from bindingDB bindingDB_purchase_target_10000.tsv to see an upper limit on how slow you'd want the app to be with this type of file datastore. If you do that the app should take about 30 seconds to load.
