Super basic example of displaying assay data in a web app.

To run locally, set up a Python virtual environment and then launch the app:
virtualenv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ./app.py 

Information is on the Flask website for running in other scenarios:
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/quickstart/

Note I have intentionally set debug=True in app.py so you will see helpful messages in the console if the app does not launch.

Free free to change the input file from bindingDB_purchase_target_subset.tsv to bindingDB_purchase_target_10000.tsv to see firsthand how much slower the app loads when all purchaseable compounds < 10uM are used as the dataset. It will probably take ~30sec to load.
